 Extreme heat events are causing substantial drops in US crop yields, a situation that will be exacerbated under future climate warming. The currently implemented subsidized indemnity- based insurance system gives little incentive for farmers to adapt their production to these changes and thus weather index-based insurance is expected to become a complement to indemnity insurance. This article explores how geostatistical interpolation via ordinary kriging can be used to inform weather index insurance contracts to reduce financial exposure of US farmers to heat risk. Using public data on county corn yields and kriging interpolated cooling degree days in Illinois, we estimate the heat sensitivity of corn for 71 counties using quantile regression. We then simulate and compare the quantile risk premiums of insured revenues with those constructed from observations from the nearest weather stations, as well as the uninsured revenues. On average, kriging-based index insurance reduces 47% and weather station-based index insurance 43% of the yield risk at the county level. For the lowest quartile of the revenue distribution, both insurance contracts reduce risk by more than 50%. Our results further show that kriging interpolation can help to improve the effectiveness of index insurance especially for situations when weather data are scarce. Our results thus deliver important lessons for improving heat insurance in US agriculture, potentially making the farming system more resilient to climatic extremes.
